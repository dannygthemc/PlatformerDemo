# PlatformerDemo
This project is a test of what can be accomplished with the Godot Game Engine.
Godot is a free, open-source game engine with a node-based architecture.
Godot can be coded using C++, C#, Rust, Nim, D or its own scripting language GDScript which is a high-level dynamic language similar to Python.
I coded this project utilizing GDScript to test the capabilities of the language.
I utilized an older version of the Godot engine to create the project, so in order to access the project files you may have to download an older version of the engine. 
The executable is not engine dependent however, and should run on Windows without any issues.
